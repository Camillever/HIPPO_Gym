<h2>Invitation to Participate:</h2>
<p> We invite you to participate in this study about using library options to accelerate the learning process.
</p>

<h2>Purpose of the Study:</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study is to to study the ways a human can learn knowledge more efficiently by leveraging different library options available during game play.
</p>

<h2>Participation:</h2>
<p>  If you wish to participate in this study, you will be asked to first complete a short survey before playing an online game. After you are finished playing the game you will be asked to complete a second short survey. <br/> 
The study should take you between 15-45 minutes to complete. <br/>
You do not have to answer any questions that you are not comfortable with, and you may stop at any point by simply closing the window and no data will be collected. <br/> 
<!-- However, for withdrawing from the study, you will receive sub-task specific compensations as outlined in the Compensation section. <br/> -->
<!-- You may take your time with the study, but we expect most participants to take 15 minutes for the first task, 25 minutes  for the human-AI interaction task and 5 minute for the survey. <br/> -->
<!-- The compensation for the entire task does not depend on the time spent on the study. -->
</p>

<h2>Benefits:</h2>
<p>There are no direct benefits of taking part in this study except for (hopefully) enjoyment in playing the different games.<br/>
Through this study, we aim to gain a better understanding about the benefits of how information is presented during learning. <br/>
This research could have broader educational, economical, and societal benefits as the information gained is expanded to other domains and target populations. <br/>
</p>

<h2>Risks:</h2>
<p> This study involves minimal risk which includes minor fatigue due to the concentration required to finish the task. <br/>
There is also the normal risk of interacting with a computer, e.g., long-term symptoms from muscle reuse like carpel tunnel syndromes. <br/>
You can withdraw from the study at any point until submitting the final response survey.
</p>

<h2>Confidentiality and Anonymity:</h2>
<p> All results from the study will remain confidential. We will only use results from the study for the purposes of this research. <br/>
The only people who will have access to the research data are the Principal Investigators and researchers working on this study. <br/>
Results will be published in pooled (aggregate) format. Your data will be anonymous as you will not be required to provide your name or any personal information.
</p>

<h2>Data Storage:</h2>
<p> The results will come from the surveys and logs based on what kind of feedback you provide to in the surveys and during game play. <br/>
This data will be stored in AWS S3 within their Canadian data centers. Only researchers on this project will have access to this data.</p>

<!-- <h2>Compensation (or Reimbursement):</h2>
<p>Participants will be paid a compensation of $15 for completing the entire task including all the sub-tasks and submitting their </br>
responses irrespective of the time taken to complete the task. However, you should correctly answer the majority of the attention </br>
check questions to claim the full compensation for a sub-task. You will be prompted by the system when you fail the majority of the </br>
attention check questions and can choose to quit the study at that point. We have task-specific compensation for completing each </br>
sub-task as outlined below:</p> -->

<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>
You are being asked to take part in a research study carried out by the above researchers. This form explains the research study and your part in it if you decide to join the study. Please read the form carefully, taking as much time as you need. Ask the researcher to explain anything you don’t understand. <br />
<br />
You can decide not to join the study. If you decide to participate in the study, you can change your mind and stop at any time. There will be no penalty or loss of services/benefits if you decide to not take part in the study or quit later. <br />
<br />
This study has been approved for human subject participation by the Washington State University Institutional Review Board [change to UofA??].
</p>
<h2>What is this study about?</h2>
<p>
This research is being conducted to study the ways a human can learn knowledge more efficiently leveraging information given by a system.<br />
Depending on which setting you are assigned, completion of the study will take between 15-40 minutes.
</p>
<h2>Are there any benefits to me if I participate in this study?</h2>
<p>
There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study. However, through this study, we will gain a better understanding about the benefits of how information is presented during learning. <br />
<br />
This research could have broader educational, economical, and societal benefits as the information gained is expanded to other domains and target populations. <br />
