	<h2>Invitation to Participate:</h2>
	<p>
		You are being asked to take part in a research study carried out by the above researchers. This
		form explains the research study and your part in it if you decide to join the study. Please
		read the form carefully, taking as much time as you need. You can decide not to join the study.
		If you join the study, you can change your mind later or quit at any time.This study has been
		approved for human subject participation by the University of Alberta Research Ethics Board.
	</p>
	​
	<h2>Purpose of the Study:</h2>
	<p>
		This project will train an artificial intelligence agent to predict the impact of including or
		excluding each minutia for a latent fingerprint identification system. Based on this new agent,
		we will use a human-in-the-loop approach to develop a system to improve minutiae labeling for
		latent fingerprint identification. <br />
		<br />You are being asked to take part because you fall in our specified age range (over 16
		years old) and have the basic knowledge in operating a computer that is necessary for the data
		collection. Depending on the configuration of the study you are taking part in, it can take
		about 15-40 minutes.
	</p>
	​
	<h2>Participation:</h2>
	<p>
		If you wish to participate in this study, you will learn the theory behind fingerprint
		identification and then undergo 30 trials of fingerprint identification.<br /><br />
		Participation in this study must all be done in one sitting. You cannot hit the back button or
		refresh, otherwise the study will restart.
	</p>

	<h2>Benefits:</h2>
	<p>
		There are no direct benefits of taking part in this study except for (hopefully) enjoying these
		different tasks.<br /><br />
		However, through this study, we aim to develop a novel software package that will serve both as
		a training tool for people with little or no experience in latent fingerprint identification and
		as a useful tool for expert latent fingerprint examiners.
	</p>
	​
	<h2>Risks:</h2>
	<p>
		This study involves minimal risk which includes minor fatigue due to the concentration required
		to finish the task. There is also the normal risk of interacting with a computer, e.g.,
		long-term symptoms from muscle reuse like carpel tunnel syndromes. You can withdraw from the
		study at any point till submitting the response.
	</p>
	​
	<h2>Confidentiality and Anonymity:</h2>
	<p>
		All results from the study will remain confidential. We will only use results from the study for
		the purposes of this research. The only people who will have access to the research data are the
		Principal Investigators and researchers working on this study. Results will be published in
		pooled (aggregate) format. Your data will be anonymous as you will not provide your name or any
		personal information.
	</p>
	​
	<h2>Data Storage:</h2>
	<p>
		The results will come from the surveys and logs based on what kind of feedback you provide to
		the AI agent. This data will be stored in AWS S3 within their Canadian data centers. Only
		researchers on this project will get access to this data.
