	<h2>Background Information:</h2>
	<p>
		Fingerprints can be classified into <strong>impressions</strong> (left) and
		<strong>latent fingerprints</strong> (right). Fingerprint impressions are acquired under
		controlled conditions and have high quality. Latent fingerprints are unintentionally left by
		someone when manipulating objects and have low quality. <br /><br />
		Latent fingerprint identification is usually related to forensic applications and has success
		rates as low as 71.32%. Consequently, latent fingerprint identification is an area of constant
		evolution, aiming to find new methods that help obtain better identification rates. Minutiae are
		the basic features used to represent fingerprints.

	<h2>Latent fingerprint identification:</h2>
	<p>
		Marking minutiae in a latent fingerprint then searching a background database for impressions
		that are most similar to this minutiae patterns. <strong>Minutiae</strong> are points where the
		fingerprint ridges become discontinuous. There are many types of minutiae, but the pertinent
		ones are: line endings (left) and bifurcations (right).
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Line ending: when the ridges come to an end.</li>
		<li>Bifurcation: when the ridge splits in two.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Study Structure:</h2>
	<p>
		You will be asked to mark a minimum of 7 minutiae per fingerprint for a total of 30 different
		fingerprints. After you submit the minutiae, you will be able to review your score as well as
		your performance in comparison to an expert.
	</p>

	<h2>Score change functionality:</h2>
	<p>
		You are given the ability to request feedback using the “Get Feedback” button. This will turn
		most of your minutiae either green or red, as well as show a number next to them. If a minutia
		is green, then removing it may decrease your score. If a minutia is red, then removing it may
		increase your score. The number beside your minutia indicates how confident our algorithm is of
		the potential score change on a scale of 0-3.
	</p>

	<h2>Beta disclaimer:</h2>
	<p>
		This study is in beta and we keep on working to improve it. Please make note of any technical
		difficulties that you encounter in the progress of the study. After the study, you will be asked
		for your feedback and will be given the opportunity to report and problems you have.
